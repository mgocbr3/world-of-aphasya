// The realm-global bound on escrow sequences in flight (the escrow write-path
// rider). The per-character depth cap in woc_market_custody.ts bounds each
// character to ONE queued-or-running escrow sequence, but nothing bounded how
// many CHARACTERS could hold one at once: the shared pg pool (10 clients by
// default) was the only realm-wide backstop, and saturating it with
// escrow-shaped work (each sequence can hold a pool client through the
// guild-flush heavy allowance and the escrow transaction's own ceiling)
// starves every other guard transaction, the sweep's locked segments, and the
// autosave wave. This gate is that missing bound: a counted in-flight cap
// with an immediate typed refusal at saturation, the seeker-executor idiom
// minus the queue (a queued waiter would just recreate the pile-up the
// refusal exists to prevent; the client's retry loop is the queue).
//
// Holds are IDENTITY-TOKENED (the qa-checklist round): a release retires its
// OWN stamp, never a positional guess, so out-of-order settlements report
// every surviving hold's age EXACTLY, the leak reclaim fires exactly at the
// ceiling for the wedged hold and no other, and a reclaimed sequence that
// later settles releases nothing (its token is already gone), eliminating
// the transient over-free the earlier FIFO approximation carried.
//
// Scope: acquired ONLY by the custody module's runSerialized entry (the
// listing escrow path). The sweep, the monitor, and the grant persist never
// touch it: the sweep's delivery work is bounded by its own batch sizes and
// busy budget, and taking this gate while holding the sweep's advisory lock
// would couple the two backpressure systems (the enqueueMarketWrite latency
// chain recorded in the rider spec).

/** Realm-global cap on escrow sequences in flight (queued plus running).
 *  Sized to the autosave wave's own SAVE_CONCURRENCY (4): the realm already
 *  prices in four concurrent character-save writes, so four escrow sequences
 *  add at most four more save-shaped holds. The tunables ladder pins the
 *  relation to the scraped SAVE_CONCURRENCY and to the pool default, so
 *  re-tuning either forces this sizing to be re-decided rather than
 *  silently diverging. (The pool-default relation is sizing arithmetic, not
 *  an enforced reserve: nothing fences the remaining clients, which also
 *  serve every non-market read on the shared pool.) */

/** A held slot older than this is treated as LEAKED and reclaimed, counted
 *  and loud: a save FIFO that never settles would otherwise pin its slot for
 *  the process lifetime, and four such wedges would close the realm's
 *  listing path until a restart (the per-character cap made that a
 *  one-character outage; a realm-global bound must not amplify it into a
 *  realm one). The slot is taken BEFORE the guild flush and the FIFO
 *  enqueue, so a hold spans the character's queue wait as well as the
 *  sequence itself, and the 5s waiter deadline does NOT end it (a
 *  deadline-cancelled job still settles only when the FIFO reaches it).
 *  The tunables ladder therefore prices the honest started-request ceiling
 *  PLUS the guild-flush heavy allowance PLUS a bounded head-of-line term
 *  (ONE heavy save queued ahead on the same character: 157s + 60s + 60s
 *  leaves this 300s ceiling 23s of slack). Inside that bound
 *  a reclaim is an incident signal rather than ordinary churn; PAST it (a
 *  character whose queue holds two or more saves each taking the full
 *  heavy allowance) the reclaim can also fire on a still-legitimate hold,
 *  which costs one over-admitted slot and a misleading line, never
 *  correctness. Identity tokens keep it exact (only the oldest hold past
 *  the ceiling is reclaimed), and the pg pool's own bounds remain the
 *  backstop for whatever the wedged sequence still holds. */
