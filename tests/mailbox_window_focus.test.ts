// The mailbox parcel list's rebuild-refocus ladder, behaviorally.
//
// renderParcels is a full wipe of #mail-parcels, and a +/- click is what triggers it, so
// a keyboard player who pressed + had the button destroyed under them mid-adjustment.
// The window has carried focus across that wipe since #1444, but only through source
// pins in tests/mailbox_window.test.ts (that the focus keys are written at all), never
// behaviorally. #2528 moved the two mechanical halves of the idiom into
// src/ui/focus_restore.ts, and a source pin cannot tell whether that migration preserved
// the LADDER, which is the part the window still owns. So this drives the real
// MailboxWindow through the real stepper buttons, on the tests/mailbox_compose_preserved
// harness, and asserts where focus actually lands.
//
// The rungs, in the window's order: the same control, then the quantity input, then `-`,
// then `+`, then Remove. Only three of the five are REACHABLE, and the extraction is what
// made that visible rather than causing it (the old hand-rolled if/else chain had the same
// shape). `minus`, `plus` and `qty` are created together inside the one `if (owned > 1)`
// block in the painter, and `qty` is never disabled, so whenever the preferred control is
// skipped and a stepper exists at all, `qty` intercepts: `-` and `+` can only ever be
// reached AS the preferred control, never as a fallback. They stay in the array as the
// defensive rungs they were before. The cases below cover every rung that can actually
// win: the preferred one, `qty`, and Remove (only when the stepper vanishes between
// renders, which needs the owned count to drop under two).
