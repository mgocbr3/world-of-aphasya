// #2506: no test file may register the same block twice.
//
// `tests/gathering.test.ts` held a second, byte-identical copy of
// `resolveCorpseFocusHarvest: concentrate vs spread tradeoff (#1142)` and of
// `harvestTierQuantity`; `tests/fixes.test.ts` held a second copy of
// `mob tap rights` and `pet heel warp`. Vitest registers duplicate titles
// silently, so all four ran, and nothing in the suite could say so.
//
// This guard exists rather than the deletion alone because the gathering pair is
// a RECURRENCE: commit a1a8cfd56 deleted the same 80 lines in July, and its own
// message records the release/v0.23.0 merge putting them straight back. A defect
// that returns through merges returns again, and the only thing that stops it is
// a check that runs on every merge.
//
// FAILURE DIRECTION, which is what decides this scan's depth (#2502): it looks
// only for offenders, so a file it fails to reach is a SILENT PASS. It therefore
// recurses, over every `.ts` under `tests/`, and takes no view about which files
// are allowed to hold blocks. `tests/` is genuinely deep (server/, admin/,
// parity/, helpers/, progression/, browser/, util/), so the recursion is pinned
// three ways: by a file-count floor set deliberately ABOVE what a flat
// top-level-only walk of this tree returns, by a depth and per-subdirectory
// check over the real tree, and structurally, by a fixture that drives this
// file's OWN producer over a nested tree.
