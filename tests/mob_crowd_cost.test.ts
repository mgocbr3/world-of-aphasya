// Crowd-cost regression bound for the idle mob-AI aggro proximity scan
// (src/sim/mob/locomotion.ts). Each idle mob scans the player grid once per tick and
// increments aggroScanPlayerVisits (src/sim/mob/scan_counters.ts) exactly once per
// player it visits. The per-tick cost of a co-located camp is therefore a product:
//
//   per-tick visits = (scanning mobs) x (players within the grid radius).
//
// This suite pins that product for a scaled-down camp, and pins the load-shedding win
// of the narrowed grid radius: players seated in the former 25-yd window (strictly
// beyond the 20-yd grid radius) contribute ZERO visits, so a crowd that spreads just
// outside the ring stops costing the camp anything.
//
// Geometry (triangle inequality, so the bound holds for every wolf whatever the
// angles): the wolves sit within 1 yd of the camp center, the near players ride a
// 12-yd ring (11 to 13 yd from every wolf, inside the 20-yd grid radius), and the
// former-window players ride a 22.5-yd ring (21.5 to 23.5 yd from every wolf, outside
// 20 but inside the old 25). Each wolf is held in place (a large wanderTimer gates off
// the idle wander MOVE while the scan still runs every tick), so the camp geometry
// never drifts and the per-tick product is exact. Every player is made trivial
// (level 30 vs the level-5 wolves) so it is VISITED (the counter increment precedes the
// isTrivialTo skip) yet never aggroed, which keeps the camp scanning idle tick after
// tick. Placing the camp at FAR (outside the 360-yd world) keeps ambient world mobs out
// of the tally, so the visit totals are exact integer literals rather than lower bounds.
