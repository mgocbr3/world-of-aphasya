// Sustainable farm yield: what a stretch of open world can pay per hour if a
// player kills everything in it as fast as it comes back.
//
// A TEST HELPER, not sim code: nothing in the live sim calls it, so it lives
// beside the suites that do rather than shipping unreferenced inside the
// deterministic core. It reads the real content tables and the real respawn
// policy, so it stays honest about the world it prices. It exists so the balance
// question "how much gold and XP per hour does this patch of world support?" is
// answered by one shared model that guard tests pin
// (tests/camp_density.test.ts, tests/economy_yield.test.ts), instead of by hand
// arithmetic in a review comment.
//
// The model is a CEILING, deliberately generous to the farmer: it assumes zero
// travel and kill time, every mob dead the instant it respawns, every non-quest
// drop vendored, and each mob at its template's top level. Real throughput is
// well under it. That is what makes it a useful guard: if even the ceiling is
// sane, the reality is.
//
// ONE INCOME STREAM IS DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED: corpse harvesting. A mob's
// componentTags open a profession path (interaction.ts harvestCorpse) whose
// yield depends on the harvester's profession level, tools and rarity rolls, so
// it is a property of the PLAYER, not of the camp, and folding a guess at it in
// would make these ceilings less comparable rather than more complete. The
// coinless harvest families are priced here at their loot-table value only,
// which for most of them is zero. Read a beast camp's copperPerHour as "coin and
// vendorable drops", not "everything a skinner can make from it".
