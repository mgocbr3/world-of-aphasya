// The shared recursive walk for guards whose corpus is SOURCE files rather than
// the `.ts` modules helpers/ts_files_under.ts returns. Same contract, same
// reasoning (a single-level `readdirSync().filter()` is silent-coverage debt:
// #2485, #2489, #2502), different extension set.
//
// A sibling rather than a knob on ts_files_under.ts, which is `.ts`-only by
// explicit ruling and directs a caller wanting another extension to write its
// own walk. Writing that walk per caller is how the extension policy ends up
// restated, and drifting, in each guard, so the policy lives HERE, once: the
// shader-domain guard needs the `.js`/`.mjs` half of the tree because the
// offline asset-pipeline inspector ships its own JS copy of the weapon shaders,
// and it needs standalone shader files because a `.frag` that never existed on
// the day a guard was written is exactly the file that leaves the scan silently.
//
// SOURCE_EXTENSIONS is therefore the complete policy, deliberately wider than
// today's tree: every GLSL string in this repo currently lives in a TS/JS
// template literal, and no `.glsl`, `.frag` or `.vert` file exists yet. Listing
// them costs nothing and means the first one added is scanned rather than
// ignored.

/**
 * Every source file under `root`, RECURSIVELY, sorted by name within each
 * directory. See {@link SOURCE_EXTENSIONS} for what counts as a source file.
 *
 * The sort matters: readdir returns byte-lexicographic order on a dev APFS
 * checkout and hash order on the ext4 CI runner, so an unsorted walk pins a
 * label list that only holds on one of them.
 *
 * Symlinks are followed on BOTH arms, for the reason ts_files_under.ts spells
 * out: a `Dirent` reports lstat, so `isFile()` and `isDirectory()` both read
 * false for one, and gating on either drops a linked module or a whole linked
 * subtree out of the scan. Two things this walk adds on top, because following
 * links unconditionally is what makes them possible:
 *
 * - A directory's resolved realpath is visited AT MOST ONCE. Without that, a
 *   link pointing at one of its own ancestors recurses until the process dies,
 *   taking the whole suite's collection with it, and two links to one subtree
 *   return every file in it twice, which double-counts any per-file pin.
 * - A directory link resolving OUTSIDE the root THROWS, naming both paths. It
 *   refuses rather than filtering, the ruling of #2499: silently skipping it
 *   would narrow the scan invisibly, and silently following it would put files
 *   no reviewer of this repo can see into a corpus pinned as a file set.
 *
 * Walks by hand rather than through `readdirSync`'s `recursive: true`, which
 * emits directory entries into its own result (so a directory named `x.ts`
 * reaches `readFileSync` and throws EISDIR), returns platform-separator paths,
 * and does not sort.
