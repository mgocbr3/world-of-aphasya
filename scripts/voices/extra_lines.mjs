// Hand-authored voiced lines that don't live on any content record: dynamic
// encounter dialogue emitted as chat 'yell' events (currently the Nythraxis raid
// from PR #665, src/sim/encounters/nythraxis.ts). gen_npc_lines.mjs synthesizes
// these alongside the greeting/quest lines.
//
// Escort-quest barks are ALSO yell-channel lines, but they live on EscortDef
// records (startText/successText/failText), so gen_npc_lines.mjs derives them
// straight from the content bundle using `yellKey` below. Do not copy them here:
// a duplicated literal would silently stop matching when the content text is
// reworded, and the clip would go quiet.
//
// `voiceNpc` is the voice folder/id the line is spoken in (must exist in
// scripts/voices/voice_ids.json). Brother Aldric reuses his existing voice.

// Stable clip key for a spoken line. MUST stay identical to the runtime
// derivation in src/ui/hud.ts (yellVoiceKey) so playback can look the clip up
// from the live event text.
