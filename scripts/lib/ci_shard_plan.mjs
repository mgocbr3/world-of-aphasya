//

// changed-path list; each pr-gate shard job then builds its own legs here:
//
//   full        today's step minus the long-sims lane: `npm test -- --shard=i/N`
//               (pretest and all) with the CI_LONG_SUITES files excluded; the
//               dedicated lane job runs exactly those files in the same run,
//               so in FULL mode the shards plus the lane run the whole old
//               suite and a fail-closed decision can never cost coverage.
//   selective   ONE merged sharded leg: `vitest related` over the changed
//               sources PLUS the always-run floor files as self-selecting
//               seeds (vitest seeds its affected set with the given paths
//               themselves), minus the lane files on the floor side, which
//               the lane job carries instead. One collection, one transform
//               pass, one sharding, where the former floor and related legs
//               paid a second vitest startup per shard. The related side is
//               deliberately NOT lane-filtered: a lane file the graph walk
//               reaches re-runs here, which duplicates work but never opens
//               a gap. `npx vitest` has no npm lifecycle, so the entry
//               (scripts/ci_shard_test.mjs) regenerates the artifacts once
//               per job before spawning, and the guard suites still read
//               fresh bytes on every shard.
//   lane        the "PR long sims A" / "PR long sims B" jobs
//               (buildLanePlan, one CI_LONG_SUITE_HALVES half each): the
//               half's collected CI_LONG_SUITES files, all of them in full
//               mode and on any unprovable input, only the floor/changed
//               members in selective mode. Both sides fail closed toward
//               their own files, so mode for mode the shards plus the two
//               lanes run exactly what the pre-lane shard plan would have
//               run (selective mode still skips the outside-floor remainder
//               by design; the audit lines and docs/qa-gate.md carry that
//               accounting).
//
// THE FLOOR. Selection's failure mode is silent (a skipped test does not
// error), so the floor is a union of three sets, each guarding a different way
// selection can under-run:
//   1. every test lib/test_visibility.mjs classifies blind or partial,
//      recomputed from source in the shard job itself so it cannot go stale;
//   2. the invariant guard suites named below, INCLUDING graph-visible ones:
//      the repo treats these as un-skippable regardless of what the diff looks
//      like, and listing them here keeps that true even if their classification
//      or the import graph shifts underneath them;
//   3. every test file the PR itself changed.
//
// Sharding: vitest partitions the COLLECTED file set, so `--shard=i/N` on the
// merged related invocation splits the floor-union-related selection 8 ways in
// one draw. A file both floor-classified and graph-reachable appears once in
// the argv and once in the collection: vitest's related set is a Set, so the
// old two-leg overlap re-runs are gone by construction.
