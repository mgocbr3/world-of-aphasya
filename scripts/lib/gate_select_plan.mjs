// The selective gate runs the FULL gate's step list (i18n gen + freshness, wiki,
// manifest regen + freshness, malware, biome, sfx, browser, typecheck, all four
// builds) and changes exactly
// one step: the full unsharded vitest run becomes one bounded merged run over
// two conceptual sets:
//
//   floor    every test whose coverage reaches outside the module graph
//            (scripts/lib/test_visibility.mjs). `vitest related` can never
//            select these reliably, so they are never selected at all: they
//            ride the argv as self-selecting seeds and just always run.
//   related  the changed source files as graph seeds, which model the
//            remaining ~80% of the suite correctly.
//
// ONE merged invocation since 2026-08-14, the same form the CI shards run
// (scripts/lib/ci_shard_plan.mjs): `related` seeds its affected set with
// the given paths themselves, so the floor files ride the related argv as
// self-selecting seeds and the old two-leg overlap re-runs are gone by
// construction. The win32 shell argv limit is the one shape that still
// chunks; see buildMergedRelatedArgs below for the strictness contract.
//
// SAFETY FALLBACK: any change this planner cannot reason about (a broad config
// file, a lockfile, a vitest/vite/tsconfig edit) drops the whole plan to the FULL
// suite. Selection is an optimization for changes we understand; anything else
// gets the old bar. Failing toward MORE tests is the only safe direction, since
// a selection miss is silent.

/**
 * The regenerated i18n artifacts the selective planner classifies into their

 * the ONLY generated trees with that standing, and it rests on two facts:
 *
 * INTEGRITY is owned by freshness, which selection never touches: ci.yml's
 * pr-checks job (and its release-checks mirror, and the full local gate's
 * i18n step) reruns `npm run i18n:gen` and fails on `git diff --exit-code`
 * over EXACTLY these paths, on every code PR, in every test mode. A
 * hand-edited or stale artifact is a red check regardless of selection.
 *
 * COVERAGE is owned by the import graph, WITH the artifacts as the entry
 * nodes: the artifacts are the most-connected runtime modules in the i18n
 * graph (src/ui/i18n.ts statically imports and re-exports the resolved
 * barrel), while their DRIVING sources (catalog, overlays) are build inputs
 * the runtime reaches only through type-erased edges, so `related` over a
 * driving source selects almost nothing. The planner therefore feeds the
 * changed artifact paths THEMSELVES to `vitest related`, which walks the real
 * import graph to every consumer (measured: a single resolved slice reaches
 * about 240 of 2296 suites). They are inert only for the widen decision,
 * never dropped from selection.
 *
 * Membership is TOP-LEVEL ONLY under the two resolved dirs: the generator's
 * orphan sweep deletes an unexpected top-level .ts on regeneration (making a
 * hand-added file freshness-red), but the sweep does not recurse, so a
 * SUBDIRECTORY path under an artifact dir is not freshness-provable and must
 * keep the unrecognized-widen behavior.
 *
 * tests/ci_workflow.test.ts pins this list against the freshness-diff paths
 * in ci.yml itself AND against the local gate's I18N_ARTIFACTS list
 * (lib/gate_steps.mjs): a path may only be listed here while both freshness
 * steps prove it, so the copies cannot drift apart silently.
 *
 * Any OTHER `.generated` path keeps today's behavior (unrecognized: widen to
 * the full suite); do not add one here without its own freshness-equivalent
 * proof.

/**

 * media manifest 230 ms measured locally on 2026-08-14), and pr-checks,
 * release-checks, and the nightly checks job all regenerate them (the
 * `wiki:content && build:bundle` step) and `git diff --exit-code` the
 * committed copies, so a stale commit is freshness-red on every code PR in
 * every mode; (2) their consumer suites reach them through the import
 * graph, so feeding the paths to `vitest related` as graph nodes keeps
 * those suites selected without widening the run.
 *
 * Membership is EXACT FILES, no prefixes: each generator owns exactly one
