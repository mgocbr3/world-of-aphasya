   *  bound to the arm its markup already implies (the board's X and Withdraw to onAbort, the
   *  ante selector's X to onClose); the capture-phase Escape handler below and the HUD's
   *  managed-window case are the callers that face either markup, and they share this.
   *
   *  It is a named method rather than inline because a THIRD caller needs it and cannot
   *  reach the handler: `Hud.closeManagedWindow`'s `lockpick-panel` case. A gamepad escape
   *  goes `main.ts dispatchGamepadAction('escape') -> hud.closeAll()` with no DOM event for
   *  a keydown listener to intercept, so before #2517 that path fell to the managed-window
   *  `default:` arm (a bare `display: none`), leaving the 100ms countdown running against a
   *  hidden subtree, the focus trap armed on an invisible panel, and the session live on the
   *  server, which then burned the tries out and FORFEITED the chest a withdrawal preserves.
   *
   *  WITHDRAW, THEN RE-SEND ONCE AND CLOSE. `submitAbort()` deliberately does not hide the
   *  panel: the close comes from the authoritative lockpickEnd, which offline the sim emits
   *  and `flushEvents()` drains inside this very call, but ONLINE is a wire command whose
   *  answer is a frame away. So online the panel is still up when `requestClose` returns, and
   *  a caller that asks again would withdraw forever. `SkinEventController.open()` is exactly
   *  that caller: it sweeps `for (i < 20 && closeTop())` to clear the stack before a roll
   *  reveal, and without the latch it would spin all 20 iterations here and never reach the
   *  windows underneath. Latching also unwedges the panel when the answer never comes at all:
   *  `ClientWorld.lockpickState` is rebuilt purely from events and is not reset on reconnect,
   *  so a stale one would otherwise leave a board that no input could dismiss. The repeat arm
   *  hedges with a second abort before it closes, because a dropped first send and one still
   *  in flight look identical from here; see the comment on that arm for why. */
