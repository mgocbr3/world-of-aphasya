// Should the character sheet and the bags dock side by side (the touch pairing)?
//
// On the touch HUD a window fills the screen, so the bags would sit ON TOP of the
// paperdoll and the drag-to-equip gesture would have no visible target to land on.
// When both are open we therefore split the viewport 50/50, exactly as the bank and
// the vendor already do with their bags companion (body.bank-open).
//
// The bank/vendor/market clusters OWN the bags companion when they are up (their own
// pairing docks it), so this one stands down there rather than fighting them for the
// layout. Desktop never pairs: its windows are free-floating and already show both at
// once.
