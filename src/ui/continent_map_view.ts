// Pure, host-agnostic draw model for the world map's CONTINENT overview level:
// the WoW-style "zoom out to the whole world" surface reached by right-clicking
// the per-zone map (or the level-toggle button). It maps the static world layout
// (every ZoneDef rect + the world bounds) plus the player's position to a flat
// geometry model in canvas-pixel space: the contain-fit rect where the painted
// continent art blits, one clickable/hoverable rect per zone (already projected),
// the "you are here" marker, a dot per party member, and which zone the player
// currently stands in.
//
// The pure-core half of the pure-core + canvas-painter split (root CLAUDE.md
// Conventions; reference map_window_view.ts / map_window_painter.ts). No DOM, no
// Three, no 2D context, no i18n, no color: the painter (continent_map_painter.ts)
// owns the context, resolves the --color-map-* tokens, and localizes the zone
// labels. Regions carry the zone id (never the resolved name) so the painter
// resolves localized text and the hover/click hit-tests key on identity.
//
// DOM-free / i18n-free / deterministic so tests/continent_map_view.test.ts can
// drive it directly with both a Sim-shaped and a ClientWorld-mirror-shaped stub.
