// Pure view-core for the one-time performance nudge toast (DOM-free,
// Node-tested in tests/perf_nudge_view.test.ts; registered in UI_PURE_CORES).
// The thin DOM consumer is src/ui/perf_nudge_toast.ts; the suggestion ids come
// from the client perf-doctor analyzer (src/game/perf_doctor.ts), assembled by
// src/game/perf_nudge.ts after real gameplay frames (packet 0 rulings R14-R16).
//
// The nudge is the sibling of the boot-time gpu notice (gpu_notice_view.ts):
// cosmetic-only and gameplay-neutral (it hides nothing and delays nothing a
// player acts on; it only EXPLAINS a machine-local cause of bad performance and
// says what to do about it). It shows at most once per install PER CAUSE SET:
// the consumer persists the dismissal keyed by the id set that triggered it, so
// the same causes never re-nag but a NEW cause re-arms the toast.
//
// Only the two MACHINE-LOCAL analyzer arms nudge the player: software
// rendering ('hardware-acceleration') and the hybrid-laptop integrated GPU
// ('integrated-gpu'), which the analyzer keeps mutually exclusive (software
// wins, ruling R15). The other suggestion ids stay fleet diagnostics only.
