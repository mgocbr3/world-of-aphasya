// One-time, signature-keyed repair of stored keybind profiles left corrupted by
// two shipped-then-reverted layout changes. Pure (no DOM); it operates on the
// already-parsed bindings blob so Keybinds.load() stays a thin consumer and the
// repair is unit-tested directly.
//
// Why a signature repair instead of a general guard: a stored blob carries no
// version marker, so nothing distinguishes "the old convention" from "a
// deliberate remap that merely looks unusual". A heuristic that reverts any
// value resembling the old layout also reverts legitimate remaps and can drop
// the bindings they collide with. Each repair below therefore fires ONLY on the
// EXACT corrupted signature and simply DELETES the affected keys, so they fall
// back to their current defaults; every other stored value is left untouched.
//
// Signature A, the Q/E strafe overhaul (commit 1d2678f58, reverted by #1788):
// that overhaul shipped SLOT_DEFAULTS[10] = ['KeyQ','Minus'] and [11] =
// ['KeyE','Equal'] with Strafe Left/Right on empty defaults, so a profile SAVED
// during its window persisted slot10/slot11 holding Q/E and strafeLeft/
// strafeRight unbound. After the revert those explicit stored values stick (a
// stored binding always wins over the current default), so pressing Q/E drives
// action-bar slots and strafe is dead. Dropping the four keys re-seeds strafe to
// Q/E and slot10/slot11 to Minus/Equal, the current defaults.
//
// The same v0.24.0 window (#1792) also shipped Damage Meters defaulting to
// KeyZ, so a profile matching the rest of Signature A typically also persisted
// meters: ['KeyZ', null]. meters now defaults to Shift+KeyH, but the stored
// KeyZ sticks like the other four, and it is processed before Sheathe/
// Unsheathe Weapon in BIND_ACTIONS: it claims KeyZ first, so the load-time
// uniqueness sweep silently evicts sheathe's untouched KeyZ default down to
// unbound. Signature A therefore also drops meters when it resolves to KeyZ
// with an empty secondary, re-seeding meters to Shift+KeyH and freeing KeyZ
// back to sheathe. A meters:KeyZ value seen WITHOUT the rest of the signature
// is a deliberate remap and is left alone (see the test for that case).
//
// Signature B, the targetFriendly/meters KeyH collision: both used to default to
// KeyH, and the uniqueness sweep handed KeyH to Target Nearest Friendly
// (Targeting precedes Interface), so the next save() persisted Damage Meters as
// [null, null]. Damage Meters now defaults to Shift+KeyH, but a stored null wins
// over the default, so the collision victims stay unbound. clear() has no caller
// in src/ and the rebind-capture flow treats a null capture as CANCELLED, not as
// an unbind, so a stored null for meters can only be loader eviction, never
// player intent: dropping the key re-seeds meters to Shift+KeyH.
