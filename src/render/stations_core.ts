// Pure placement core for the crafting-station scenery (Professions 2.0).
// Maps each station record supplied through the active IWorld seam to the
// world-space prop cluster the Three half
// (stations.ts) places at it: one thematic anchor prop BESIDE the station
// pos (the point itself is an interaction target routes end on, and the
// props are solid) plus a little fixed clutter. Hand-authored offsets, not
// procedural scatter, so exact spots matter more than variety; offsets keep
// clear of each resident master
// NPC (1 to 3 units beside the station, see the STATIONS placement notes).
//
// Deliberately NO radius ring, circle, or boundary decal spec: the station
// gate has no visual precision by design (the Eastbrook loom/toolworks
// overlap is a documented drift note).
//
// Three/DOM/i18n-free and deterministic (RENDER_PURE_CORES) so a plain
// Vitest can pin that every station gets a cluster and every placement
// stays anchored to its station pos.
