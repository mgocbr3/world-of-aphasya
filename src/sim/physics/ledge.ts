// Ledge detection for the climb (mantle) move: can this body, mid-jump, get
// its hands on something above it and pull up?
//
// The traversal ladder this completes, by how high the obstacle is above the
// feet:
//   below MAX_STEP_HEIGHT      the body strides over it, no input      (step)
//   up to MANTLE_REACH airborne a jump arc carries it over the rim     (vault)
//   up to LEDGE_GRAB_MAX       a jump GRABS it and climbs up           (climb)
//   above that                 it is a wall
//
// The first three rungs meet with no gap on purpose: MANTLE_REACH equals
// MAX_STEP_HEIGHT equals LEDGE_GRAB_MIN, so no standable top is ever a wall to
// an airborne body that a grounded body would have strided straight over.
//
// Everything here is a pure query against the same extruded-2D collider set
// and heightfield the solver uses, so a climb can only ever start onto a
// surface the body could legitimately stand on: a standable prop top (crate,
// rock, cart, low wall) or walkable terrain. It never grabs a full-height
// blocker, never grabs into an overhang, and never grabs a surface the body
// would not fit on.
//
// No rng, no wall clock, no allocation beyond the single result object the
// caller owns.
