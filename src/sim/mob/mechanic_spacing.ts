// Shared spacing lock between a rift boss's attack mechanics.
//
// Every boss mechanic in runMobAttackMechanics (mob/locomotion.ts) runs on its
// own free-running timer, so any two of them land on the same tick whenever
// their cadences align (playtest 2026-07-30: the Abyssal Maw feared and AOE'd
// the same instant). On a rift-spawned boss (riftMechanicSpacing stamped by
// rift/runs.ts) the player-facing mechanics share ONE per-entity lock:
//
// - A mechanic may only FIRE while the lock is clear; firing re-arms the lock
//   for riftMechanicSpacing seconds (a hardcast adds its cast time on top, so
//   an instant can never land while a telegraph bar fills either).
// - A mechanic that comes due while the lock runs HOLDS AT DUE: its own timer
//   is not reset, it keeps drifting negative, and the drift is the mechanic's
//   overdue age. When the lock clears, the OLDEST-DUE governed mechanic fires
//   next (mechanicSlotHeld: a due driver yields to any strictly more overdue
//   one; ties fall to driver order). On a kit whose total demand exceeds one
//   fire per spacing window this stretches every cadence proportionally
//   instead of starving whichever driver happens to run last, so no mechanic
//   is ever deleted from a fight and none loses a pending cycle.
//
// Deliberately NOT governed: aoeSlow (the anti-kite snare must keep its own
// cadence or a kiter earns free windows; it does however HOLD AT DUE while a
// telegraph escape window is open, mob/rift_escape_window.ts), stoneskin (a
// self-buff that never lands on players), the updateBossMechanics support kit
// (summonAdds is hp-threshold-driven; heals/wards are not player-facing
// pressure), the on-hit dread fear (it only ever hits the swing victim, and
// like every on-hit control proc it skips its effect inside an escape
// window), and the heroic charge trigger (it fires from the engaged-tick hook
// before the mechanics tail, chase state included). infernoChannel is
// lock-gated at its fire site but sits outside the oldest-due comparison: its
// cadence deliberately FREEZES while the lock runs (its hp-gate consumption
// must not happen on a held tick), so it cannot accumulate a comparable
// overdue age. No shipped rift kit carries it; revisit if one ever does.
//
// The lock ticks only while the boss is engaged AND in melee contact, the same
// gate the governed timers themselves tick under: a kited boss freezes with
// its held mechanics, then resumes the drain on re-contact. One deliberate
// asymmetry: an instant-mechanic WINDUP (mob/rift_escape_window.ts) ticks on
// the engaged hook (chase included), so a telegraph whose ring is already on
// the ground resolves even while the boss chases; the lock it armed stays
// frozen until re-contact, which only ever spaces mechanics further apart.
//
// No SimContext, no rng, no DOM; reads only the static MOBS table and the
// rift rank gate. A Vitest imports it directly. Inert for every mob without
// the spawn stamp, so world and dungeon bosses (and the parity goldens that
// drive them) are untouched.
