// Tier-crossing master mail (Professions 2.0): when an ATTUNED
// character's ACTIVE pair advances one of its two major crafts to a new tier,
// the pair's resident master writes them a congratulatory Ravenpost letter. A
// 1 Hz sweep beside the Guild trend letter sweep (professions/guild_letter.ts),
// the same single evaluation chokepoint for every craft-skill mutation path plus
// the load backfill case. Draws NO rng and emits nothing itself: it only books a
// letter via ctx.mailAuthoredLetter (the guild_letter idiom), so appending it in
// the mail phase cannot fork the deterministic draw order.
//
// Only the active pair's two MAJORS are watched: never the hobby, a dormant
// craft, or (obviously) an unattuned character. Per-craft acknowledgement lives
// in PlayerMeta.tierMailSent (a Map, persisted with zero-default omission), whose
// baseline arming both migrates already-attuned characters at deploy (no
// retroactive spam) and baselines a freshly- or newly-majored craft at its
// current tier, so the FIRST mail is only for a tier crossed AFTER attunement.
// The same rule needs the record PRUNED on every pair transition
// (pruneTierMailToActiveMajors below): an acknowledgement that outlived its
// craft's major status would make a later RETURN to that pair skip the silent
// re-baseline and mail a retroactive letter for tiers crossed while dormant.
//
// This module is `src/sim`-pure (see src/sim/CLAUDE.md): no DOM/render/ui/game/net
// imports, no Math.random/Date.now, host-agnostic.
