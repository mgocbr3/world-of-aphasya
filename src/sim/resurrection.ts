//
//  - Resurrection Sickness (player-facing display name "The Keeper's Toll"): the debuff a
//    Pale Keeper resurrection inflicts, up to 10 minutes.
//  - Unstuck Sickness: the debuff a completed /unstuck inflicts, up to 5 minutes. Unstuck
//    no longer kills or routes through the Pale Keeper, so this is the whole price it
//    charges for skipping the walk.
//
// Both are the same mechanic (a level-scaled whole-stat-block drain that cannot be shed by
// dying or relogging) with different ceilings, so they share one leaf module. It imports
// only ./types and the ./moderation leaf, so every death and respawn site (combat/damage,
// spirit, entity_roster, delves/runs) plus the two clean-slate wipes (social/arena,
// social/fiesta) can share the "which auras survive this wipe" predicates and the
// level-scaled duration WITHOUT an import cycle (spirit <-> entity_roster both need it).
