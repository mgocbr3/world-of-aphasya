// Tuning model (economy retune, 2026-07): every heroic mob is pinned to LEVEL
// 22 (two above the level-20 player cap). The calibration target is a FLOOR,
// not an average: the minimum non-crit swing of EVERY heroic mob (spawn-list
// trash, boss-summoned adds, and the Nythraxis encounter waves) lands at
// least 500 post-mitigation on the maximum-mitigation reference warrior, a
// level-20 prot in the max-armor kit (full heroic plate + shield, prot
// mastery: 2861 armor) standing in Defensive Stance (takes 10% less), who
// receives ~39.8% of a raw level-22 swing. Health is DOUBLED versus the
// previous heroic calibration across the board. Solving the 500 floor at each
// dungeon's WEAKEST spawn-list mob inverts the multiplier ladder (harder
// dungeons carry bigger base weapon damage, so hollow_crypt needs the largest
// multiplier and gravewyrm_sanctum the smallest); bosses ride the same
// dungeon-wide multiplier and land their natural premium above trash.
// Exceptions via damageMultiplierByMob: the three Sanctum bosses are lifted
// so heroic Sanctum out-hits its retuned NORMAL mode (which floors bosses at
// 600), and the Nythraxis raid boss floors at 1200 with its add waves held to
// the 500 line per mob. Mechanic damage lands RAW (no armor step; see
// aoePulse/stomp in ../mob/locomotion.ts) and scales with the mob's own
// multiplier via mechanicDamageMult; support heals scale with
// mechanicHealMult (= healthMultiplier); both wired in
// ../instances/difficulty.ts. Gravebreaker (the raid boss frontal) derives
// from boss.weapon, so it scales through the template transform on its own.
// Floors are pinned by tests/heroic_difficulty_floors.test.ts.
// NORMAL-difficulty retunes. Normal spawns default to the raw base templates;
// a dungeon appears here only when its normal mode needs its own calibration.
// Unlike the heroic table this one is PER MOB, because the floor-style targets
// below need different factors for trash, non-elite adds (no 1.5x elite swing
// multiplier), and bosses. The per-mob factor also drives mechanicDamageMult,
// so a boss's aoePulse/stomp scale with its own melee (../instances/difficulty.ts),
// UNLESS the mob has a mechanicDamageMultiplierByMob override: that decouples an
// AVOIDABLE telegraphed mechanic from the unavoidable tank-swing calibration, so
// a skill check can stay lethal while melee intake is priced for the fresh tank.

// Velkhar: boss dtps on a fresh tank now runs ~179-193, pressed above a
// fresh healer's sustain so the tank loses ground without cooldowns; tanks
// are crit-immune since v0.29.1, so no swing can spike past the 1.25x roll
// cap (~38% of pool). Korzul's melee sits below Korgath's per-multiplier
// because he also carries the guaranteed inferno channel (the 50% hp gate)
// on top of his 30% enrage.
// Korzul additionally carries a mechanicDamageMultiplierByMob override: his
// Grave Inferno channel is fully avoidable (rooted boss, no melee during it,
// true-radius telegraph), so it prices at 15x, lethal to a ~1000hp fresh
// melee pool that stands all four pulses (1050-1350 raw) while pulse one
// stays a scratch; his melee stays on the tank calibration above. The
// DOUBLED health stays: the economy lever is clear time, not lethality.

  //    as a third Zulgar. Nythraxis set the same precedent (its own 600/300
  //    bands rather than the five-man 500/250).
  // 2. rangedDamageMultiplierByMob for the two petSpell casters. HALF the
  //    20-spawn roster (stalker x6, hexcaller x4) is a ranged caster that never
  //    melees, so its damageMultiplierByMob factor is inert and its real output
  //    is a petSpell nuke no other knob reaches. Priced to the same 100 minimum
  //    hit as trash melee: unmitigated by armor and landable on any group
  //    member, which is what makes them the priority kill the content brief
  //    calls for. Their melee factors are still solved to the 100 floor so a
  //    caster cornered in melee range (the chase arm) is on-model too.
  //
  // Mechanics ride each mob's own melee factor with NO override, which is the
