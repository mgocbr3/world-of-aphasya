// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Delve Marks vendor stock, Collapsed Reliquary (Brother Halven)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Gate semantics:
//   'available'     , purchasable from the first time Brother Halven opens
//                      the vendor (no run requirement).
//   'clears:N'      , unlocks after the player has completed N runs of this
//                      delve (any difficulty; counts Normal + Heroic clears).
//   'heroicClear'   , unlocks after the player completes at least one Heroic
//                      (difficulty ≥ 2) run.
//
// Pricing intent (the Collapsed Reliquary is the ENTRY-tier delve):
//   Marks income rides the daily window: the first 3 clears of the day (a
//   single tally shared across delves) pay full base Marks (1 Normal / 2
//   Heroic; the Drowned Litany doubles both) PLUS any earned chest/rite bonus;
//   every later clear pays a diminished base only, with no bonus Marks (see
//   `delveMarkPayout` and `delveBonusMarksFor` in src/sim/delves/runs.ts).
//   That puts a Normal-only player here around 3-9 Marks/day by lockpick
//   skill (the chest's loot tier sets the bonus), and a flawless Heroic runner
//   at 12 in-window; the Litany's 2x lifts those bands to 18 flawless Normal
//   and 24 flawless Heroic. Past the window a grinder still drips diminished
//   BASE Marks per clear without bound (Heroic 1, doubled at the Litany), so
//   this is a bounded full-rate window plus a slow drip, not a hard daily
//   cap. Prices are deliberately STEEP relative to that income, the reward
//   gear is a clear upgrade over the silver-vendor armor of the same tier
//   (Smith Haldren's commons: chainmail vest 60 armor, leather jerkin 40,
//   robe 22, trousers 24), so each piece is uncommon-or-rare quality with
//   stat bonuses on top. A casual player kits out over ~2-3 weeks; the Heroic
//   signature rares are a multi-week goal each.
//
//   FORWARD DESIGN: later delves are tuned to cost FAR more Marks (and reward
//   far more Marks per clear), so this tier's prices are the floor of a long
//   currency curve, not the ceiling. Keep new shops keyed under DELVE_SHOPS.

  // These eight are the tier-4 and tier-5 picks, axes, sickles and rods that
  // otherwise only an engineer at a toolworks can produce (recipes.ts
  // TOOL_RECIPES and ROD_RECIPES). A player who never took a crafting
  // profession had no path to the top of the tool ladder at all; this is that
  // path, priced in Marks rather than in a profession.
  //
  // NO NEW PRICE RUNGS AND NO NEW GATES. Both rows reuse this shop's existing
  // top two: tier 4 sits on the helm's rung (24 Marks behind three clears, the
  // "commitment" step) and tier 5 on the signature-rare rung (56 behind a
  // Heroic clear, the multi-week goal). That is deliberate rather than
  // convenient, because the Litany's whole price ladder is pinned as a straight
  // 2x of the Collapsed Reliquary's tiers (tests/delve_shop.test.ts), and a
  // bespoke tool price would either break that relationship or force an
  // invented mirror row into the entry delve where a top tool does not belong.
  //
  // They land HERE rather than on the Heroic Quartermaster's counter, which was
  // the other candidate: HEROIC_VENDOR_ITEMS (content/heroic_vendor.ts) is a
  // self-contained ItemDef registry that never reads ITEMS, so a tool row there
  // means a duplicate def of an item that already exists, and its stock is
  // budget-enforced level-20 jewelry (tests/item_level.test.ts) whose stated
  // identity is being the game's only source of necks and rings. A stat-less
  // tool fits neither. A DelveShopEntry's itemId resolves into ITEMS directly,
  // and delveShopGateUnlocked below is already shared by the authoritative buy
  // and the client's lock badge, so these rows need no new gate logic anywhere.
  //
  // This does NOT weaken the tools' never-sold rule, it sharpens it: the claim
  // is that no counter sells them FOR COPPER, and Marks are a delve currency
  // earned by running the delve. The guards in tests/professions_tools.test.ts
  // and tests/professions_rod_recipes.test.ts assert exactly that, and were
  // widened to sweep this table (and the heroic vendor's) rather than only
  // NPCS[*].vendorItems, which would have let these rows through in silence.
  //
  // These rows carry NO proficiency requirement, and that is the SETTLED
  // answer (maintainer ruling, 2026-08-14), no longer an open question: under
  // R22 every tool purchase gate in the game is advisory, and enforcement
  // lives at the harvest via the wield gate (professions/wield_gate.ts, tiers
  // 4/5 at gathering 85/100), which a Marks-bought land tool meets or waits on
  // exactly like a crafted one. The item tooltip prints the same
  // "Requires {craft} N" line the copper counters show
  // (tests/gather_tool_tooltip.test.ts), so the buyer is warned before
  // spending. The clears gate is what paces these rows; rods stay wield-exempt
  // under R22 and are paced by the water-tier gate instead.
  //
  // RE-CHECK TRIGGER: these prices assume a world whose highest shipped node
  // and fishing-water tier is 3, where a tier-4/5 tool opens no content and
  // its value is fine-grade minting, cast speed, and comfort. The patch that
  // ships the first tier-4 node or water (the post-level-20 zone expansion)
  // turns these into ACCESS items: re-derive both Marks prices and the wield
  // table in that SAME change, not after.
