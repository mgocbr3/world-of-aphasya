# Eastbrook Vale rebuild: exact image-generation prompt records

This file preserves the exact image-generation tool inputs for the accepted Eastbrook concept
lineage, every turnaround batch, and both rejected full-gate corrections. It is the canonical
prompt record cited by [imagegen-provenance.md](imagegen-provenance.md).

## Record authority

The ten fenced JavaScript blocks below preserve the image-generation tool inputs
from a Codex session (transcript path redacted). Session timestamps are UTC.
Generation occurred on 2026-07-23 local time.

Each block keeps the shared reference-path array, common prompt literal, per-asset
prompt suffix literals, and the interpolation expression passed to imagegen.
**Machine-local absolute paths were rewritten to repo-relative or redacted forms**
(for example `docs/screenshots/...` and `codex-generated-images/<id>.png`) so this
repo does not store personal filesystem locations. Prompt prose and structure are
otherwise unchanged.

Each listed payload SHA-256 is the original session hash over the unredacted
`payload.input` UTF-8 bytes at generation time. After path redaction the fenced
blocks are no longer byte-identical to that payload; do not recompute the listed
hashes against the redacted text.

Some payloads contain Unicode punctuation. A changed-file copy scanner must still
treat the prompt prose as archival; do not "normalize" punctuation in the fenced
blocks.

Generated filenames are the immutable imagegen-store originals. Accepted
destination paths are relative to `docs/screenshots/eastbrook-vale-rebuild/`.
Rejected bytes remain outside Git.

  prompt: `Create one original World of ClaudeCraft master-concept image for rebuilding Eastbrook Vale, using ONLY the attached original in-game captures as visual style, scale, terrain, player-rig, banker-chest, and Grand Armoury references. This is a reconstruction-ready, stylized Three.js game-environment concept, not photorealistic fantasy art and not an imitation of any existing commercial game.

VIEW AND SITE
- Wide 16:9 elevated three-quarter planning view, high enough to show the complete town and all circulation, but close enough to read doors, yards, stalls, and the 2.6-yard player scale.
- Preserve the real terrain, six outgoing dirt-road approaches, and their directions from the top-down capture.
- Complete a low original gray-stone-and-dark-timber perimeter wall at approximately 30 yards radius, with exactly six generous road-aligned gate openings about five yards wide. The source branch contains no visible wall geometry, so this wall must be newly designed rather than copied.
- Keep generous negative space and unobstructed gate-to-center lanes.

IMMUTABLE LANDMARK
- Preserve the attached Eastbrook Grand Armoury’s exact cobalt-roofed design and southeast placement. It must remain plainly the largest, tallest, most ornate, and most important building from the gates and central green.
- Keep its approximate 13-yard by 9-yard footprint and 15-yard roofline. Every other building must stay below about two-thirds of its height and footprint.
- Preserve the small procedural banker chest design and player scale.

MASTER PLAN
- An open central civic green/square centered near the current well, with a modest below-four-yard circular stone well incorporating one restrained blue-crystal beacon and four low benches.
- Six clearly separate, compact service buildings ringing the green without overlap:
  1) northeast bank, about 7 by 5.5 yards, banker-facing entrance, chest sheltered beside its counter porch;
  2) north smithy, about 7 by 5.5 yards, broad open forge bay, chimney, weapon rack, and a low fenced workyard;
  3) northwest inn/tavern, about 7.5 by 6 yards, welcoming porch and kitchen yard;
  4) west chapel/shrine, about 5.5 by 6 yards, modest and visibly secondary;
  5) southwest weaving workshop, about 5.5 by 4.5 yards;
  6) south toolworks, about 5.5 by 4.5 yards.
- A tiny organized market of exactly three coherent stalls on the northwestern edge of the green, with low selective fencing that never blocks a lane.
- Show obvious dry paths from all six gates to the green, and from the green to every service doorway and the Grand Armoury.
- Leave the southeast landmark facade unobstructed.

VISUAL LANGUAGE
- Extend, but do not clone, the Armoury language: deep Eastbrook-blue pitched roofs, gray stone foundations/lower floors, warm dark timber upper structures, restrained blue-and-gold trim, recessed doors and windows, roof overhangs, warm emissive windows, occasional blue crystal wayfinding lamps.
- Strong simple silhouettes and large vertex-color value groups suitable for deterministic low-poly Three.js geometry with zero textures.
- Player-readable doors, thresholds, stairs, counters, awnings, signs, barrels, crates, flowers and smith tools only where useful; no tiny ornament.
- Complete three-dimensional buildings with visible side and rear depth; no facade cards or shallow shells.
- Warm, welcoming starter-town mood and clear service hierarchy.

HARD EXCLUSIONS
- No readable lettering, pseudo-text, logos, watermarks, proprietary symbols, copied geography, copied building silhouettes, castle motifs, or recognizable compositions from RuneScape or any other game.
- No giant towers besides the preserved Armoury, no dense urban fill, no impossible slopes, no roof hiding the Armoury, no maze fences, no excessive crystal clutter, no unrelated characters, no photorealism.

Render this as a clean, plausible in-engine concept that a procedural Three.js artist can rebuild efficiently.`

Make these precise corrections:
1. Preserve the ACTUAL attached Eastbrook Grand Armoury silhouette and proportions much more faithfully. It stays on the southeast/right side at its existing lot, 13×9 yards and approximately 15 yards tall. Do not reinterpret it as a giant castle or add extra large towers. Its familiar broad cobalt roof, southeast massing, warm windows, and restrained gold/blue details remain the sole landmark.
2. Show exactly SIX distinct smaller service buildings, all obviously separate and all below two-thirds of Armoury height/footprint:
   - northeast BANK: compact 7×5.5, sheltered porch/counter, banker and the small accepted dark chest nearby;
   - north SMITHY: compact 7×5.5, open glowing forge bay, single chimney, low fenced workyard;
   - northwest INN/TAVERN: compact 7.5×6, broad welcoming porch, warm windows, small kitchen yard;
   - west CHAPEL/SHRINE: modest 5.5×6, restrained gable and tiny blue crystal finial, never castle-like;
   - southwest WEAVING WORKSHOP: 5.5×4.5, visible loom-textile bundles in its yard;
   - south TOOLWORKS: 5.5×4.5, visible tool bench/crates in its yard.
3. Keep the organized market at exactly three stalls along the northwest edge of the green, but make sure it is separate from the inn and does not substitute for one of the six buildings.
4. Keep exactly six road-aligned gate openings, each broad and unobstructed. Keep all gate-to-center and center-to-door lanes clearly at least three player-widths clear. No fence may cross a path.
5. Keep the civic well/beacon below four yards and visually secondary to every major building.
6. Use fewer incidental characters. Include only a few 2.6-yard stylized player/NPC figures for scale and service association.
7. Maintain complete 3D side/rear depth, large value groups, zero-texture procedural feasibility, and the stylized World of ClaudeCraft in-game renderer look.
8. No text, pseudo-text, logos, watermarks, proprietary motifs, photorealism, copied commercial-game geography, or unrelated scenery.

The result must read as a measured build plan: one preserved landmark, exactly six subordinate buildings, three stalls, a modest central feature, six gates, and safe obvious circulation.`

- Add one clearly distinct compact INN/TAVERN building in the currently open northwest arc, behind and slightly west of the three market stalls but inside the wall.
- The inn is approximately 7.5 yards wide by 6 yards deep and no more than 8.5 yards tall, below two-thirds of the Grand Armoury.

- It must be a complete 3D building with readable side/rear depth.
- Keep at least a three-yard clear lane around it; do not block the nearby west or north gate; do not move the market into a gate lane.
- The final visible inventory must be ONE Armoury plus exactly SIX smaller buildings: smithy, bank, inn, chapel, weaving workshop, toolworks.

preserved silhouette but lost too much of the concepts' mid-frequency material character. The
full-color image is retained as first-party source evidence. A deterministic processor converts
its sixteen semantic cells into a high-key, mostly grayscale 512 px multiplicative detail atlas,
so runtime vertex colors remain the palette authority on every graphics tier.

No people except one plain unbranded scale silhouette in a separate scale panel; no scenery, readable text, logos, proprietary symbols, watermark, or photorealism.
